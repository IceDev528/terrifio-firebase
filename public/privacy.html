    Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify

<p>
    <strong>Marketing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses,
    particularly around marketing and advertising.
</p>
<p>
    We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to
    form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of
    interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers
    may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
</p>
<p>
    Prospective customers may receive marketing and other communications from
    us if you have requested information from us or if you provided us with
    your details when you entered a competition or survey and, in each case,
    you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
</p>
<p>
    Existing customers may receive marketing and other communications from us
    provided you have not opted out of receiving those communications.
</p>
<p>
    We will not share your personal data with any third parties for marketing
    purposes without your express consent.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Opting Out</em>
</p>
<p>
    You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at
    any time by checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing
    preferences in your account area on the Platform or by following the
    opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by Contacting us at
    any time.
</p>
<p>
    If you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will still contact
    you as necessary to perform any contract with you.

    <strong>5. Change Of Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected
    it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason
    and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get
    an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible
    with the original purpose, please email: info@terrif.co.uk.
</p>
<p>
    If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
    notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge
    or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or
    permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Who Do We Disclose Your Personal Data To</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below
    where they are involved in providing services to us. We will only share
    personal information about you that is reasonably necessary for the other
    companies to have in order to provide their services to TERRIFIO. These
    companies are contractually bound to use personal information we share with
    them only to perform the services we have engaged them to provide:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge
            parts of our business or our assets (because personal information
            about the selling entity’s customers is typically one of the assets
            that is transferred to the buyer). Alternatively, we may seek to
            acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to
            our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the
            same way as set out in this privacy notice.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data
    and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party
    service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only
    permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in
    accordance with our instructions.
</p>
<p>
    If you contact an IP Professional User (as defined in the Platform User
    Terms) via the Platform, we will disclose your personal data to them to the
    extent necessary for them to get in touch with you. If you then retain the
    IP Professional User to provide services to you, the IP Professional User
    will act as a controller in relation to your personal data and their use of
    your personal data will be governed by the terms of their own privacy
    policies or notices.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. International Data Transfers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    TERRIFIO primarily stores the personal data we collect in the United
    Kingdom. To facilitate TERRIFIO’s global operations, staff who work for
    TERRIFIO, TERRIFIO CANADA and/or our service providers may transfer and
    access such personal data from locations around the world. This will
    involve transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area
    (EEA).
</p>
<p>
    We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal
    data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure one
    of the following safeguards is implemented:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
            been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
            data by the European Commission; or
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission
            which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We will ensure there is some other protection in place which has
            been approved by the European Commission as giving personal data
            the same protection it has in Europe.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>10. Data Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards
    that are designed to protect your personal information from being
    accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or
    disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those
    employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business
    need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions
    and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Employees who misuse
    personal information are subject to disciplinary action.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
    completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
    information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to
    our websites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received
    your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to
    try to prevent unauthorized access.
</p>
<p>
    We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data
    breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where
    we are legally required to do so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>11. Data Retention</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil
    the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying
    any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
    consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
    potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal
    data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we
    can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including
    Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they
    cease being customers.
</p>
<p>
    In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request
    erasure below for further information.
</p>
<p>
    In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can
    no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in
    which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice
    to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>12. Your Legal Rights</strong> 
</p>
<p>
    Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
    relation to your personal data as set out below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data
            subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the
            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
            processing it.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
            This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
            about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
            the new data you provide to us.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
            to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for
            us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
            delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
            exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
            may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
            required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
            Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
            request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
            notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on
            a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
            something about your particular situation which makes you want to
            object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
            fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
            where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
            legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
            rights and freedoms.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
            enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
            data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish
            the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but
            you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the
            data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
            exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
            use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
            legitimate grounds to use it.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
            party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
            your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
            format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
            which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
            the information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
            process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
            lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
            consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to
            provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
            this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us
    at info@terrifio.co.uk.
</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>No Fee Usually Required</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
    any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
    request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we
    may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>What We May Need from You</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
    your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
    exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
    that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
    receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in
    relation to your request to speed up our response.
</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>Time Limit To Respond</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally
    it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex
    or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and
    keep you updated.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13. Glossary</strong>

<p>
    <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>
    means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business
    to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most
    secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential
    impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we
    process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
    personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the
    impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or
    permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we
    assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in
    respect of specific activities by emailing info@terrifio.co.uk.
