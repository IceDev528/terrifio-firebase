                                  Under the “New Project” button, you answer
                                  questions relating to your New Project. The
                                  Platform provides a “Name” field for you to insert
                                  a generally descriptive term, in 24 characters or
                                  less. The Platform urges you not to reveal any
                                  confidential features of your New Project. The
                                  Platform provides a field for you to identify your
                                  country and a general subject area (type) relating
                                  to your New Project.

                                  The Platform then asks you several general
                                  questions about your activities with your New
                                  Project, and the date(s) of the earliest of such
                                  activities. The Platform asks about these dates
                                  because they may have a bearing on your IP
                                  protection strategy and, more particularly, may
                                  indicate if you need to act quickly to seek the
                                  advice of an IP Professional to confirm deadlines
                                  arising from your activities. If you provide
                                  incorrect dates then this may lead to irrevocable
                                  loss of rights, for which the Platform takes no
                                  responsibility. The Platform does not do anything
                                  to validate or verify these dates. Once you
                                  complete the questions, the Platform stores data
                                  representing your answers and prepares a Report
                                  which is conditioned on (i.e. it includes clauses
                                  that are added according to) your answers, and in
                                  some cases including possible deadlines as
                                  discussed below. Your answers and the Report will
                                  be available to you in your Dashboard (the “Project
                                  Information”).

                                  The Platform uses an algorithmic method for making
                                  general calculations of possible deadlines for
                                  taking actions in relation to your New Project. If
                                  you answer questions incorrectly, then the possible
                                  deadlines may be calculated incorrectly and the
                                  Platform is not responsible for any consequences
                                  arising from such incorrect calculations.
